bbcode.php 1.006




you can update the bbcode on your nodesforum simply by putting this bbcode.php file instead of your old one in your forum install.

there should normally not be any problem, the bbcode file is conceived to be independant but to stay extra safe you might wanna rename your old bbcode.php file to something else to have a backup if you experience any issue with the new bbcode file.

this bbcode php code is also conceived to be self-sufficent so that you can possibly use it in your own php applications if you want.
